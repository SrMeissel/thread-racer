# thread-racer
A very fast racing game written for multi-threading practice. Made with Visual Studio to also practice cpp dev tools. :)  

Cloning a empty repo then trying to create a project within that repo puts everything in a nested file. I am not a fan of that and am going to try to avoid that next time.  

Must admit, the debug mode is real nice and I feel like a fancy man when using visual studio.
